# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

BasicsOS is a CRM hub built with React, Vite, and a Node/Hono REST API. It provides contact/deal/company management, task tracking, notes, AI chat, automations, voice (placeholder), and MCP viewer. Data is backed by PostgreSQL via Drizzle; auth uses Better Auth.

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
pnpm install
docker compose up -d   # Postgres on port 5435
cd packages/server && cp .env.example .env && pnpm db:migrate
```

### Running the App
```bash
pnpm run dev:rest     # Frontend + API server (recommended)
pnpm run dev          # Frontend only
pnpm run dev:server   # API server only
pnpm run dev:demo     # Demo build (uses main app)
```

### Testing and Code Quality

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run lint:apply
pnpm run prettier:apply
```

### Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Database Management (Drizzle)
```bash
cd packages/server
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:seed         # admin@example.com / admin123
pnpm db:studio
```

### Registry (Shadcn Components)

```bash
pnpm run registry:build
```

### Key Architecture Patterns

#### Objects vs Apps

The codebase has two fundamentally different building blocks:

- **Objects** = CRM entities (contacts, companies, deals, tasks, custom objects). Database-driven via `object_config` table, discovered by `ObjectRegistryProvider`, rendered by generic `ObjectListPage`/`RecordDetailPage`, routed under `/objects/:slug`. New objects require zero frontend code — just a DB row and migration.
- **Apps** = Independent feature areas with their own routes, UI, and logic. Examples: Home (`/home`), Chat (`/chat`), Automations (`/automations`), Voice (`/voice`), Settings (`/settings`), Import (`/import`), Tasks (`/tasks`), Notes (`/notes`), MCP Viewer (`/mcp`). The CRM itself is the largest app — it contains objects within it.

When building a new feature, ask: "Is this a new type of record the user creates/lists/edits?" → **Object**. "Is this a standalone tool or page with its own UI?" → **App**.

#### Object Registry (CRM Objects Only)

Objects (contacts, companies, deals, tasks, etc.) are configured via `object_config` and `custom_field_defs` tables. `ObjectRegistryProvider` and `useObject` / `useAttributes` expose configuration. List and detail views are generic: `ObjectListPage`, `RecordDetailPage` for `/objects/:objectSlug` and `/objects/:objectSlug/:recordId`.

#### Views (NocoDB-style)

Views, columns, sorts, and filters are persisted via `/api/views/*` and used by the data table. `useViews` and `useViewState` manage view selection and dirty state.

#### CRM REST API

`packages/server` exposes `/api/*` routes for CRM resources, schema, object-config, connections, automation-runs, gateway-chat, etc. Auth is session-based via Better Auth.

#### Automations

`@basics-os/automations` provides a workflow builder with trigger (event, schedule) and action (email, AI, CRM, Slack, Gmail, …) nodes. Variables like `{{trigger_data}}`, `{{ai_result}}` are resolved at execution. Topological sort is used for execution order and variable availability.

#### Path Aliases

- `@/` → `src/`
- `basics-os/src` → `src/` (for packages importing from main app)

#### Gateway Configuration (Self-Hosting)

- `BASICSOS_API_URL` defaults to `https://api.basicsos.com`. All gateway traffic (chat, embeddings, voice) goes through the server.
- Forkers can override it to point at their own gateway. No UI changes; users still add their API key in Settings.
- Key format validation is in `GatewayProvider.tsx` (line 11) and `SettingsPage.tsx` (line 58). Different gateways may need different prefixes.

### Adding Custom Fields

1. Add migration for `custom_field_defs` or schema changes in `packages/server`
2. Ensure the field type exists in `src/field-types`
3. Update object config if needed

### Git Hooks

- Pre-commit (husky): lint-staged

### Local Services

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
- API: VITE_API_URL (e.g. http://localhost:3001)

## Important Notes

- Modify `src/components/ui` directly for UI customization
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` in `src/`
- `/connections` redirects to `/settings#connections`; OAuth `?connected=` is preserved and handled in Settings
