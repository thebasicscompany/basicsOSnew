description: Coding practices for frontend development in Basics OS. Use when creating or modifying React components, list pages, detail views, forms, data fetching, field types, or responsive layouts.

The frontend uses React 19, TanStack Query, React Router v7, and Shadcn UI. Data flows from the Hono REST API (`/api/*`) via custom hooks. There is no React Admin.

## Architecture

- **Objects vs Apps**: The codebase distinguishes **objects** (CRM entities like contacts, deals — DB-driven, generic UI via ObjectRegistry) from **apps** (standalone features like Chat, Home, Automations — each with own routes, hooks, and custom UI). `ObjectRegistryProvider` is for CRM objects only. Apps have their own data models independent of ObjectRegistry.
- **Object Registry** (CRM only): Objects are configured via DB. `ObjectRegistryProvider` wraps the app. Use `useObject(slug)`, `useAttributes(slug)`, `useObjects()` from `@/hooks/use-object-registry`.
- **Generic list/detail** (CRM only): `ObjectListPage` and `RecordDetailPage` serve `/objects/:objectSlug` and `/objects/:objectSlug/:recordId`. They are driven by the object registry and attributes.
- **Views (NocoDB-style)**: Sorts, filters, and column config are persisted via `/api/views/*`. Use `useViews(objectSlug)` and `useViewState` from `@/hooks/use-views`.

## Data fetching

- **Records**: `useRecords(objectSlug, params)`, `useRecord(objectSlug, recordId)` from `@/hooks/use-records`.
- **Mutations**: `useCreateRecord`, `useUpdateRecord`, `useDeleteRecord` from `@/hooks/use-records`. All use TanStack Query (`useMutation`) and call `@/lib/api/crm`.
- **Other API**: Use `fetchApi` from `@/lib/api` or `useQuery`/`useMutation` with custom query functions.

## UI components

- **Shadcn UI**: Import from `@/components/ui/` (Button, Card, Dialog, Sheet, etc.).
- **Field types**: Each attribute has a `uiType` mapping to a field type. Use `getFieldType(uiType)` from `@/field-types`. Field types provide `CellDisplay`, `CellEditor`, `FormInput`, and optional `TypeConfig` for admin UI.
- **Forms**: `RecordForm` renders a dynamic form from an `Attribute[]` and `values`/`onChange`. Used by `CreateRecordModal` and record detail inline edit.

## Conventions

- **Paths**: `@/` → `src/`. Use `basics-os/src` for packages importing from the main app.
- **App pages vs object pages**: An "app page" (e.g., ChatPage, HomePage) is a standalone feature with its own route at `/{name}`. An "object page" uses the generic `ObjectListPage`/`RecordDetailPage` at `/objects/:slug`. Don't use ObjectRegistry for app pages.
- **Data table**: `DataTable` + `useDataTable` for list views. Supports pagination, sorting, column resize, and view persistence.
- **Responsive**: Use `useIsMobile()` (or similar) when branching layouts. Deals have a kanban toggle via `DealsLayoutToggle`.
- **Auth**: Session-based via Better Auth. Use `authClient` from `@/lib/auth-client` for sign-in/sign-out/session checks.
