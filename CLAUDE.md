## Electron Packaging Rule

`electron.vite.config.ts` → `main.build.externalizeDeps` MUST stay `false`. Never change it. electron-builder does not ship node_modules for the main process — all deps must be bundled by Vite. Changing this causes ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND crashes in packaged DMGs. See AGENTS.md and RELEASE.md for details.
