## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need the following tools installed on your computer:

- Make
- Node 22 LTS
- Docker (required by Supabase)

### Postgres + REST mode (alternative to Supabase)

You can run the CRM with a local Postgres database and REST API instead of Supabase:

1. Start Postgres: `make docker-up` (or `docker compose up -d`)
2. Configure server: `cd packages/server && cp .env.example .env`
   - Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   - `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `PORT` have defaults
3. Run migrations: `make db-migrate`
4. Seed demo data: `make db-seed` (creates `admin@example.com` / `admin123`)
5. Start app + server: `make start-rest` (or `pnpm run dev:rest`)

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and log in with `admin@example.com` / `admin123`.

### BasicOS AI Assistant (optional)

The AI assistant requires a separate API. To run it:

1. `cd packages/api && cp .env.example .env`
2. Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from `supabase start`)
3. `npm run dev:api` (or `make start-api`)

See [packages/api/README.md](packages/api/README.md) for details.

### OpenChat UI (optional)

A ChatGPT-style chat interface is available as a clone of [OpenOrca/openchat-ui](https://github.com/OpenOrca/openchat-ui):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenOrca/openchat-ui.git
make start-chat-ui
```

See [openchat-ui/README.atomic-crm.md](openchat-ui/README.atomic-crm.md) for configuration.

Fork the [`marmelab/atomic-crm`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm) repository to your user/organization, then clone it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/atomic-crm.git
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
cd atomic-crm
make install
```

This will install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend, including a local Supabase instance.

Once your app is configured, start the app locally with the following command:

```sh
make start
```

This will start the Vite dev server for the frontend, the local Supabase instance for the API, and a Postgres database (thanks to Docker).

You can then access the app via [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). You will be prompted to create the first user.

If you need debug the backend, you can access the following services:

- Supabase dashboard: [http://localhost:54323/](http://localhost:54323/)
- REST API: [http://127.0.0.1:54321](http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- Attachments storage: [http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments](http://localhost:54323/project/default/storage/buckets/attachments)
- Inbucket email testing service: [http://localhost:54324/](http://localhost:54324/)
